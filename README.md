Drone Fishing

An open source repository for our Remote Control Drone Fishing Kit!

The Drone Fishing kit is a small battery powered device that you can connect to your drone.  
You then hook your fishing line from your fishing pole to the slider bar on the device.

Remotely connect to the device with wifi and then fly your drone out to the location you want to fish, 
Issue a single command and it will drop your bait into the water and your fishing.

Fly your drone home, or fly higher to watch your bait.  Don't scare away the fish!

Reel in your pole like normal, due to your extended cast you sure to catch a fish!
Just be careful and dont get your line tangled up somewhere!

We outline all the parts you need to put together your own drone fishing device!
Or you can buy our kit and assemble it yourself or order a fully assembled kit.

This is Fishing Awesome!
